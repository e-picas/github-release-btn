GitHub Release Button
=====================

A dynamic and customizable "*last release*" button for any GitHub repository
with version number and tarball link. Releases MUST follow the [SemVer](http://semver.org/)
specifications.

To begin, have a look at <https://ghrb.herokuapp.com/>.

The rendering is something like: 

[![last release](https://ghrb.herokuapp.com/github-release-btn?user=piwi&repo=github-release-btn)](https://github.com/piwi/github-release-btn/releases)
